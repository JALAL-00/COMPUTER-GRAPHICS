# This repository contains my work from the Computer Graphics course, including:
	•	 Lab Tasks: Practical exercises focused on OpenGL programming and fundamental graphics techniques.
	•	 Practice Projects: Extra mini-projects to reinforce concepts like animation, transformations, and rendering.

It serves as a record of my learning and hands-on experience with computer graphics, primarily using C/C++ and OpenGL.
